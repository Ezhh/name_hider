name_hider
=========

Minetest mod by Shara RedCat which adds two commands:

1. '/hidenames' hides the nametags of all currently connected players.
2. '/shownames' shows the name tags of all currently connected players.

to use these commands, you need to have the 'hidenames' privilege, which you can grant with:

`/grant <player> hidenames`

server admins and single players automatically have this privilege.
